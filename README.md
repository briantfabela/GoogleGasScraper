# GoogleGasScraper
A web scraping algorithm using Selenium on python 3.7.1 that visits a list of known gas stations with listed gas prices, scrapes them, and writes them to csv file.

A python web crawler can be deployed on a headless browser to identify gas stations from the google maps search sidebar (scrollbox iterating through all search results) that have price information available and mine the gas stations that will be used to get info via the scraper.
